Introduction
============

Lets start by importing some modules we will be using:

  >>> from Products.OpenId.store import ZopeStore
  >>> from openid.association import Association
  >>> import time

Next we create a store object:

  >>> store = ZopeStore()

The zope store is a smart storage implementation:

  >>> store.isDumb()
  False


Associations
============

Lets create a new association:

  >>> now = int(time.time())
  >>> a = Association(handle="handle", secret="secret", issued=now,
  ...                 lifetime=600, assoc_type="HMAC-SHA1")

We can store the association and retrieve it via a server_url and its handle:

  >>> store.storeAssociation("http://localhost", a)
  >>> b = store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  >>> a == b
  True

If we ask for an association with a None handle the store should still
return an assocation for the server:

  >>> b = store.getAssociation("http://localhost", None)
  >>> a == b
  True

Trying to retrieve a non-existing association should return None:

  >>> store.getAssociation("http://nothere") is None
  True
  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "nothere") is None
  True

Associations can be removed based on their server_url and handle. The
return value for removeAssociation indicates if an assocation has been
removed.

  >>> store.removeAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  True
  >>> store.removeAssociation("http://localhost", "handle")
  False

In an attempt to clean up expired associations retrieving them will
automatically remove them:

  >>> a = Association(handle="handle", secret="secret", issued=now-10,
  ...                 lifetime=5, assoc_type="HMAC-SHA1")
  >>> store.storeAssociation("http://localhost", a)
  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "handle") is not None
  True
  >>> store.getAssociation("http://localhost", "handle") is not None
  False

Nonces
======

OpenId uses nonces, which are basically ids used to track outstanding
requests. A nonce is a strin.

Storing nonces is simple, and a nonce can be stored multiple times:

  >>> store.storeNonce("one")
  >>> store.storeNonce("two")
  >>> store.storeNonce("two")

Using a nonce means checking if a nonce is in the store and removing it
if so:

  >>> store.useNonce("one")
  True
  >>> store.useNonce("one")
  False

Even if a nonce is stored twice using it will completely remove it:

  >>> store.useNonce("two")
  True
  >>> store.useNonce("two")
  False


Authentication keys
===================
Each store gets a unique authentication key:

  >>> isinstance(store.getAuthKey(), str)
  True
  >>> other = ZopeStore()
  >>> other.getAuthKey() == store.getAuthKey()
  False
